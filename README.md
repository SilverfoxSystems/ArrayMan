# ArrayMan
This library lets you sort the last dimension of an array of Long and ULong integers (signed and unsigned 8-byte integers). It works very fast.

 The example here demonstrates the usage of library "ArrayMan.dll", which is the only file you need to sort arrays in your projects.
In the example, you can also compare the time spent for sorting with ArrayMan and the time spentwith the default VB sorting algorithm.

In future, I'm planning to add support for Integer, Byte, Single and Double arrays. I can also add the ability to sort other dimensions, not only the last one.
